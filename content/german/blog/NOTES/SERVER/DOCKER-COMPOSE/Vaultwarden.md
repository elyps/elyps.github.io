Below is an example of how to run Vaultwarden using Docker Compose.

1. **Create a project directory**
    
    Create a directory to store your Vaultwarden instance files and Docker Compose configuration:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir vaultwarden
    cd vaultwarden
    ```
    
2. **Create a docker-compose.yml file**
    
    In the project directory, create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following contents:
    
    ```yaml
    version: "3"
    
    services:
      vaultwarden:
        image: vaultwarden/server:latest
        container_name: vaultwarden
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - "80:80"         # Exposes Vaultwarden on port 80; adjust if needed
        volumes:
          - ./vw-data:/data # Persists Vaultwarden data on the host
        environment:
          # Enable websockets if you use the browser extension (optional)
          WEBSOCKET_ENABLED: "true"
          # Optionally set an admin token for accessing the admin panel
          # ADMIN_TOKEN: "your-admin-token-here"
    ```
    
    **Notes:**
    
    - The `volumes` mapping (`./vw-data:/data`) ensures your data is persisted between container restarts.
    - Exposing port `80` is a simple configuration; in production you may want to run behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) or use TLS.
    - Uncomment and set `ADMIN_TOKEN` if you wish to enable and secure the admin interface.
3. **Start Vaultwarden**
    
    Run the following command to start Vaultwarden in detached mode:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
4. **Verify the container is running**
    
    Check the status with:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```
    
    You should see the `vaultwarden` container running.
    
5. **Access Vaultwarden**
    
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost` (or replace `localhost` with your serverâ€™s IP or domain) to use Vaultwarden.
    
6. **(Optional) Manage logs and updates**
    
    - To view logs:
        
        ```bash
        docker-compose logs -f
        ```
        
    - To update Vaultwarden, pull the latest image and restart the container:
        
        ```bash
        docker-compose pull
        docker-compose up -d
        ```
        

This configuration provides a straightforward setup for Vaultwarden using Docker Compose. Adjust ports, volume paths, and environment variables as needed for your deployment scenario.
